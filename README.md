### Known issues

#### !!Permissions!!
  In order to run this you will need permission to read from `/dev/input/*`
  Rather than rewrite the wheel, please see 
  https://github.com/jteeuwen/evdev/blob/master/README.md#permissions
  which has a great explanation

### bundler/gem install fail
  adding just ```gem 'vigilem-evdev'``` is different than ```gem install vigilem-evdev```
  In both cases the vigilem-evdev gem installs it's input_system dependencies on install, however since 
  bundler isolates it's installed gems the dynamically installed gems get added to the $GEM_HOME and not
  the bundler cache. So in order exactly model production the 'vigilem-x11' needs to be added 
  ```
  gem 'vigilem-evdev'
  gem 'vigilem-x11'
  ```
  @see focus_context_filter.rb and input_system_handler.rb

## FAQ
  - why does vigilem-evdev require vigilem-x11-stat?: 
      This is convenience for gnome-terminal so that it:
        - doesn't read the keyboard when the window doesn't have focus
        - this matches how win32 does things and makes it more cross platform

## Roadmap
 + 1.0.0:
   - @todo's, bug fixes, KeyMap load performance
   - Mac/Bsd
   - mouse
   - jettison 'linux-system' items into own gem
   - less brittle tests
 + next
   - complete ffi items
